Contains logic analyzer sessions of communication between the CYC photon and the DS103 display. I'll try to include as much relevant information as I can.

Session 1: Battery was sitting at 55.5V according to a cycle analyst I am using in my system. The photon seems to always read about 0.6V higher though. Ch0 is the controller transmit line, ch1 is the display transmit. Things I did. Turned on the system. Changed assist mode a few times, briefly hit the throttle with the wheel off the ground. Finally turned the system off.
